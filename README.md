# Evaluate Ratings Data Using NoSQL (PyMongo)

## Summary/Overview 
**Fictional**
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. I've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

## Data Source 
UK Food Standards Agency(2022). [UK food hygiene rating data API] (https://ratings.food.gov.uk/open-data/en-GB)

## Technologies 
- PyMongo (NoSQL)
- Pandas
